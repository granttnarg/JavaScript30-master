    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let tea = 1
    let play = tea

    console.log(tea, play)

    tea = 2



    console.log(tea, play);




    let team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Lux";


    console.log(players, team);


    // however what happens when we update that array?

    let team2 = players.slice();

    console.log(players);
    console.log(team2);

    team2[0] = "TESTING"

    console.log(players);
    console.log(team2);

    console.log(team666 = [...players])
    console.log(team666 = Array.from(players));

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      social: {
        twitter: "@TheCapitan"
      }
    };

    const captain = person

    captain.number = 99;

    console.log(person.number)

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12});
    console.log(cap2);
    console.log(captain);
    console.log(person);

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));

    console.log(dev2)

    person.social.twitter = "yoyoyo"

        console.log(dev2)
            console.log(person)
